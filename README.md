# Package Managers

Metadata extracted from [Libraries.io](https://libraries.io) about many different package managers in a standard format.

String interpolation of commands and urls is done using [mustache](https://mustache.github.io/) in an attempt at cross language compatibility.

All data is stored in JSON where the key for each package manager is the name of the repository in lower case.
